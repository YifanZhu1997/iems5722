This is an Andriod online chatting application with some basic features.

## Login/Sign up (Feature mostly developed by Yifan Zhu, UI mostly developed by Wei Fang)
Once openning the application, you need to create your account with an unique user name, an unique user ID and your password by using the "Sign up" function, then you can log in using your account. The page will be re-directed to a public chatroom list.

## Red Envelope (Mostly developed by Yifan Zhu)
While you are inside a chatroom, you can send out a red envelope with the total money and number to be set by clicking the top-right "red envelope" button. The money will be reduced in your balance, and you can check out your remaining balance outside the chatroom.
